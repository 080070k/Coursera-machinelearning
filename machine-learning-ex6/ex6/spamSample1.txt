New SMU course: 1108 vying for 45 places

SMU has received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the new Politics, Law and Economics (PLE) degree course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in the total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. SMU Provost Professor Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She noted that it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers, adding that SMU hopes to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews.

Business schools offer classes to make start-ups sustainable
In view of the mushrooming of start-ups and spurt in entrepreneurial drive, premier management institutions such as SMU, Indian School of Business and Woxsen School of Business are coming up with innovative offerings on a variety of aspects, to help start-ups remain sustainable. SMU President Professor Arnoud De Meyer said the biggest challenge for a start-up is scaling up the operations, noting that a big area in which universities and business schools can contribute is by innovation, research and hands-on teaching. He emphasised that the start-up teams should be trained in marketing, finance and proto-typing of strategies. “I believe, as neutral players, we as academicians have a role to play in the current scenario,” he added.

'Minority-only contest would send wrong signal'

SMU Assistant Professor of Law Jack Lee shared his views on the issue of minority representation at the third public hearing of the Constitutional Commission to review the Elected Presidency yesterday. He proposed that a committee be appointed to identify suitable minority candidates with the help of organisations such as civil society groups and unions, similar to how Nominated Members of Parliament are selected.

Law don wants to bar ministers, MPs from endorsing candidates

SMU Assistant Professor of Law Jack Lee has called for the elected presidency to be depoliticised by prohibiting government office-holders and Members of Parliament (MPs) from endorsing any candidate. He said any statement that can be interpreted by the public as an endorsement should be disallowed, even if ministers and MPs speak in their personal capacity. "It is very hard for the public to distinguish between someone speaking in his political capacity as a member of government, and in his personal capacity," he said. Assistant Prof Lee also wants the work of the Presidential Elections Committee to be more transparent. It should, for instance, give detailed reasons to a candidate for his or her application for a certificate of eligibility being turned down.

Greenpeace warrior poorer but happier

SMU Masters in Wealth Management alumnus Calvin Quek was featured in a Straits Times article which profiled his journey from a banker to an environmental activist. The former Citibank banker is now the Head of Sustainable Finance at Greenpeace East Asia based in Beijing, and the go-to guy for researchers, investors and policymakers wishing to know more about environmental and energy issues in the Middle Kingdom. When Mr Quek was doing his MBA at Peking University, he started a Green Club and attended events organised by the Beijing Energy Network (BNE), a grassroots outfit interested in environmental issues in China. He got to know Greenpeace staff at BNE events and started volunteering for the outfit, which is well-known for its direct actions. Not long after he finished his MBA, he joined Greenpeace's sustainable finance team.

First day of Elected Presidency hearings kicks off

SMU Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan have spoken at the first of four public hearings on proposed changes to the Elected Presidency on April 18. He opposed constitutional changes that would ensure the election of a minority president. Instead, it should be left to the electorate to vote for their preferred candidate. “If we design it that way, it takes away a tremendous amount of authority and legitimacy from the presidency. I’m not sure that engineering the outcome will help with nation building,” Associate Prof Tan said.
